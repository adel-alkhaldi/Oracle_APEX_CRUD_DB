## üìñ Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation of my **Oracle Database** and **Oracle APEX** implementation project completed during my internship at **Al-Ain University Information Technology Center (ITC)**. 

The project involved designing and implementing a university library management system using Oracle's enterprise database technology stack. This documentation encapsulates my entire internship journey, covering both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practical implementation.

Another thing was documenting the soft skills & experience i gained

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The original codebase and SQL scripts have been lost due to technical issues. This repository serves as a complete documentation reference of the implementation process, methodologies, and lessons learned.

## üéØ **Project Scope**

The internship project focused on creating a complete Oracle database solution with the following objectives:

- **Database Design & Implementation** - Create a normalized library management schema
- **Oracle Database 19c Setup** - Install and configure multitenant architecture with PDBs
- **Oracle APEX Development** - Build low-code applications for database interaction
- **Enterprise Configuration** - Set up ORDS, Apache Tomcat, and networking components
- **Documentation & Learning** - Document the entire process for future reference

---

## üìö **What's Inside**

### **Complete Documentation**
The main documentation file [`OracleReport.md`](OracleReport.md) provides a comprehensive walkthrough covering:

- **Project Requirements & Design** - From requirements gathering to ERD creation
- **Oracle Database Installation** - Step-by-step setup on Windows 11 VM
- **PDB Configuration** - Creating and managing pluggable databases
- **APEX Installation & Setup** - Complete APEX deployment process
- **Application Development** - Building CRUD operations with APEX
- **Theory vs Practice** - Academic knowledge compared to real-world implementation
- **Professional Skills Development** - Technical and soft skills gained

### **Visual Documentation**
The `media/` folder contains screenshots and diagrams illustrating:
- Database architecture and ERD designs
- Installation and configuration steps
- APEX application interfaces
- System setup and networking configuration

## üèóÔ∏è **Technology Stack Implemented**

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Database** | Oracle Database 19c | Core database engine with multitenant architecture |
| **Application Platform** | Oracle APEX 20.2 | Low-code development platform |
| **Web Server** | Apache Tomcat | Application server for ORDS |
| **Middleware** | Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) | Bridge between APEX and database |
| **Development Tools** | SQL Developer, Oracle Data Modeler | Database design and management |
| **Infrastructure** | Oracle VirtualBox, Windows 11 | Development environment |

---

## üìä **Database Design**

The library management system was designed with the following core entities:
- **Users** - Central user management with role-based access
- **Students, Employees, Admins** - Specific user types with different privileges
- **Books, Authors, Publishers** - Library inventory management
- **Borrow Records, Fine Records** - Transaction and penalty tracking

The schema evolved from a simple normalized design to a more scalable role-based architecture to accommodate future expansion requirements.

## üéì **Learning Journey: Theory vs Practice**

This internship highlighted key differences between academic learning and professional implementation:

### **Academic Approach**
- Static requirements that never change
- Perfect theoretical scenarios
- Simple normalization exercises
- Isolated system design

### **Professional Reality**
- Scalable design for changing requirements
- Real-world constraints and limitations
- Forward-thinking architecture
- Integration with existing systems

---

## üí° **Key Takeaways**

### **Technical Skills Developed**
- Oracle Database administration and multitenant architecture
- APEX application development and low-code platforms
- Enterprise software installation and configuration
- Database design with scalability considerations

### **Professional Skills Gained**
- Working with enterprise documentation
- Project management and time management
- Professional communication and reporting
- Problem-solving and troubleshooting
